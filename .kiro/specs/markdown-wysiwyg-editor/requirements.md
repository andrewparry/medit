# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a fully functional browser-based markdown WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor that allows users to create, edit, and save markdown files locally. The editor should provide a seamless editing experience with real-time preview capabilities and local file management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to write and edit markdown content in a visual editor, so that I can focus on content creation without worrying about markdown syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the editor THEN the system SHALL display a WYSIWYG interface with formatting toolbar
2. WHEN the user applies formatting (bold, italic, headers, etc.) THEN the system SHALL update the content visually in real-time
3. WHEN the user types text THEN the system SHALL maintain proper markdown structure in the background
4. WHEN the user switches between visual and source modes THEN the system SHALL preserve all formatting and content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save my markdown files locally to my computer, so that I can access and manage my documents outside the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks save THEN the system SHALL prompt to download the markdown file to their local filesystem
2. WHEN the user provides a filename THEN the system SHALL save the file with .md extension
3. WHEN the file is saved THEN the system SHALL maintain proper markdown formatting in the saved file
4. IF no filename is provided THEN the system SHALL use a default naming convention with timestamp

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to load existing markdown files from my computer, so that I can continue editing previously created documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects "Open File" THEN the system SHALL display a file picker dialog
2. WHEN the user selects a markdown file THEN the system SHALL load and display the content in the editor
3. WHEN a file is loaded THEN the system SHALL parse the markdown and display it in WYSIWYG format
4. IF the file contains invalid markdown THEN the system SHALL display it as plain text with a warning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a writer, I want to see a live preview of my markdown content, so that I can verify how my document will appear when rendered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is editing content THEN the system SHALL provide a preview pane showing rendered markdown
2. WHEN the user makes changes THEN the system SHALL update the preview in real-time
3. WHEN the user toggles preview mode THEN the system SHALL show/hide the preview pane
4. WHEN content includes images or links THEN the system SHALL render them properly in the preview

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to common markdown formatting options through a toolbar, so that I can easily format my content without memorizing syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the editor loads THEN the system SHALL display a formatting toolbar with common options
2. WHEN the user clicks a formatting button THEN the system SHALL apply the formatting to selected text or cursor position
3. WHEN the user selects text and applies formatting THEN the system SHALL wrap the selection with appropriate markdown syntax
4. WHEN no text is selected THEN the system SHALL insert formatting markers at cursor position

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the editor to work entirely in the browser without requiring server connectivity, so that I can use it offline and maintain privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loads the application THEN the system SHALL function without internet connectivity
2. WHEN the user performs any editing operation THEN the system SHALL not require server communication
3. WHEN the user saves or loads files THEN the system SHALL use browser-based file APIs only
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load all necessary resources locally

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the editor to support standard markdown syntax elements, so that my files are compatible with other markdown tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user creates content THEN the system SHALL support headers (H1-H6), bold, italic, code blocks, and lists
2. WHEN the user adds links or images THEN the system SHALL use standard markdown link syntax
3. WHEN the user creates tables THEN the system SHALL use standard markdown table format
4. WHEN the file is exported THEN the system SHALL produce valid CommonMark-compatible markdown
